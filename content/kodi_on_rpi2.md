&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday I was talking to a collegue about my kodi on raspberry pi setup. Which interested him a lot. Now it's not the first time that happened to me.
Here is a little guide on how to setup the rpi.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First you will need the following hardware:
1. A raspberry pi
2. A micro SD card (with a minimum of 4GB)
3. A micro-usb cable (with the optionnal phone usb charger)
4. An 1,5m ethernet cable (the size may vary)
5.  An 1,5m HDMI cable (the size may vary)
